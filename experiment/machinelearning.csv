What is Polynomial Regression considered as in terms of linearity?,"{'a': 'Linear model', 'b': 'Non-linear model', 'c': 'Both linear and non-linear model', 'd': 'None of the above'}",c
Why is Feature Scaling not applied in Polynomial Regression model?,"{'a': 'Because it is not necessary', 'b': 'Because the coefficients can adapt their scale', 'c': 'Because it leads to overfitting', 'd': 'Because it is not supported by the algorithm'}",b
What is the main method to find the best degree in Polynomial Regression?,"{'a': 'Plotting the model visually', 'b': 'Using p-values', 'c': 'Applying feature extraction', 'd': 'Using cross-validation'}",a
Why do we need to create a new linear regressor 'lin_reg_2' in Polynomial Regression in Python?,"{'a': 'To fit a new linear model to Xpoly and y', 'b': 'To avoid overfitting', 'c': 'To simplify the code', 'd': 'To improve accuracy'}",a
What is the advantage of Random Forests compared to Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'Better interpretability', 'b': 'Higher computational efficiency', 'c': 'Better predictive power', 'd': 'Simpler implementation'}",c
When should you use SVR instead of linear regression?,"{'a': 'When dealing with linearly distributed data', 'b': 'When linear regression fits the data well', 'c': 'When dealing with non-linear problems', 'd': 'When interpretability is important'}",c
What does Information Gain measure in Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'Standard Deviation Reduction', 'b': 'Entropy', 'c': 'Disorder in a set', 'd': 'Homogeneity of data'}",a
Why is p-value not applicable for feature selection in Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'Because Decision Trees are non-linear models', 'b': 'Because Decision Trees do not have coefficients', 'c': 'Because Decision Trees do not involve statistical significance', 'd': 'Because Decision Trees are not suitable for feature selection'}",a
