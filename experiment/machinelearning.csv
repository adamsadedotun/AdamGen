What is the main difference between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression?,"{'a': 'Polynomial Regression is always a non-linear model, while Linear Regression is always a linear model.', 'b': 'Polynomial Regression is a linear model on the coefficients but a non-linear function of the input, while Linear Regression is a linear model on both coefficients and input.', 'c': 'Polynomial Regression is a non-linear model on the coefficients but a linear function of the input, while Linear Regression is a linear model on both coefficients and input.', 'd': 'There is no difference between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression.'}",b
Why do we not apply Feature Scaling in Polynomial Regression model?,"{'a': 'Because Feature Scaling is not necessary for Polynomial Regression.', 'b': 'Because the coefficients in Polynomial Regression can adapt their scale to put everything on the same scale.', 'c': 'Because Polynomial Regression automatically scales the features internally.', 'd': 'Because Feature Scaling would lead to overfitting in Polynomial Regression.'}",b
When should you use Support Vector Regression (SVR)?,"{'a': 'When dealing with linearly distributed data.', 'b': 'When a linear model like linear regression fits the data well.', 'c': 'When dealing with non-linear problems and data that is not linearly distributed.', 'd': 'When you want to use p-values for feature selection.'}",c
What is the advantage of Random Forest Regression over Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'Random Forests provide better interpretability than Decision Trees.', 'b': 'Random Forests can give better predictive power than Decision Trees.', 'c': 'Decision Trees are faster to train than Random Forests.', 'd': 'Decision Trees are more accurate than Random Forests.'}",b
How do you find the best degree in Polynomial Regression?,"{'a': 'By selecting the highest degree available.', 'b': 'By finding the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the model.', 'c': 'By using p-values for feature selection.', 'd': 'By randomly choosing a degree and testing it.'}",b
What is the purpose of SVR in Machine Learning?,"{'a': 'To fit linear models to non-linear data.', 'b': 'To provide better interpretability than Decision Trees.', 'c': 'To handle non-linear problems and data that is not linearly distributed.', 'd': 'To reduce the number of features in a dataset.'}",c
Why do we need to use 'sc_Y.inverse_transform' in SVR?,"{'a': 'To scale the features in SVR.', 'b': 'To make predictions on scaled data.', 'c': 'To go back to the original scale after feature scaling.', 'd': 'To apply cross-validation in SVR.'}",c
What is the Information Gain in Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'It measures the disorder in a set.', 'b': 'It calculates by how much the Standard Deviation decreases after each split.', 'c': 'It is the same as the Entropy in Decision Trees.', 'd': 'It is the reduction of standard deviation of the predictions.'}",b
