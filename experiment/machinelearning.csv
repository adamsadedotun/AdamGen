What is the main difference between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression?,"{'a': 'Polynomial Regression is always non-linear, while Linear Regression is always linear.', 'b': 'Polynomial Regression is linear on the coefficients but non-linear on the input, while Linear Regression is linear on both.', 'c': 'Polynomial Regression is always linear, while Linear Regression is always non-linear.', 'd': 'There is no difference between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression.'}",b
Why do we not apply Feature Scaling in Polynomial Regression?,"{'a': 'Because Feature Scaling is not necessary for Polynomial Regression.', 'b': 'Because the coefficients in Polynomial Regression can adapt their scale to put everything on the same scale.', 'c': 'Because Polynomial Regression does not involve any scaling of variables.', 'd': 'Because Feature Scaling is only applicable to non-linear models.'}",b
When should you use Support Vector Regression (SVR)?,"{'a': 'When dealing with linearly distributed data.', 'b': 'When a linear model like linear regression fits the data well.', 'c': 'When dealing with non-linear problems and data that is not linearly distributed.', 'd': 'When you want to use p-values for feature selection.'}",c
What is the advantage of Random Forest Regression over Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'Random Forests provide better interpretability than Decision Trees.', 'b': 'Random Forests can give better predictive power than Decision Trees.', 'c': 'Decision Trees are faster to train than Random Forests.', 'd': 'Decision Trees are more robust to overfitting than Random Forests.'}",b
How do you find the best degree in Polynomial Regression?,"{'a': 'By selecting the highest degree possible to minimize error.', 'b': 'By visually plotting the model and testing different degrees.', 'c': 'By using p-values to determine the significance of each degree.', 'd': 'By fitting the model with the highest degree polynomial.'}",b
What is the purpose of SVR in Machine Learning?,"{'a': 'To fit linear models to non-linear data.', 'b': 'To provide better interpretability than other regression models.', 'c': 'To handle non-linear problems where data is not linearly distributed.', 'd': 'To perform feature selection based on p-values.'}",c
Why do we need to use 'sc_Y.inverse_transform' in SVR?,"{'a': 'To scale the features before fitting the SVR model.', 'b': 'To transform the predicted values back to the original scale.', 'c': 'To apply feature selection to the SVR model.', 'd': 'To convert the SVR model into a linear regression model.'}",b
What is the Information Gain in Decision Trees?,"{'a': 'It measures the disorder in a set after a split.', 'b': 'It calculates the reduction in standard deviation after each split.', 'c': 'It determines the significance of each feature in the decision tree.', 'd': 'It quantifies the decrease in entropy with each split.'}",b
